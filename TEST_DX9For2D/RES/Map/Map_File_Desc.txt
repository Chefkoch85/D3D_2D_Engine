General:
--------
A map-file is a binary file and contains a map in tiles.
the file descripes each tile and the position in the file is the row and the column
on the screen

Header:
-------
Size		=	16 byte
Game Version	=	 2 byte [BYTE] 2x (1:Major,2:Minor)
Map Version	=	 2 byte [BYTE] 2x (1:Major,2:Minor)
Map identifier	= 	 4 byte [CHAR] 4x (TMAP)
=======
For each indexed entry exists a single file with the index contents, 
i.e. for the names of the regions and warzones.

The map file itselfs contains the starting conditions of a map
but the same file type is to used save game stats

For Citiy tiles the single parts will be treat a little bit other
of course initial, current and conquer faction also region and warzone name and of course the flags remain the same meaning
